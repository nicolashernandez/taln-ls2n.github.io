The project Naviterm, financed by the Agence de l’Innovation de Défense (AID) and the CNRS, has been accepted for funding.

It will aim to accelerate the increase in skills of researchers in a research field by the automatic creation of synthetic and navigable terminological representations of scientific knowledge.

The project is led by Florian Boudin and will involve Béatrice Daille and Richard Dufour.
